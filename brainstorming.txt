limited purchases, when you used them all you prestige and gain more or less currency depending on how well you used the resources

first prestige the balance doesn't really allow for decision making but as you buy prestige upgrades choice will be more important

you're in a supermarket and wanna escape, you need to buy stuff in order to run out of it faster but you have a limited amount of space so you can't just buy everything

3 types of upgrades, money making, running speed and endurance (same upgrade limit shared, endurance so that you can't just escape the supermarket in the first prestige by waiting 2 days)

when you're out of upgrades you get the option to prestige and restart with a boost

the supermarket has a set size, when you ran far enough you escape it and then either it's the end or i find something else to do
